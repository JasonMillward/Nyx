Nyx is a light weight and responsive theme for [Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost).

It uses HTML5 Boilerplate for its core, snugly wrapped in Bootstrap and Masonry with just a little bit of jQuery dolloped on the side.

All custom stylesheets are constructed in LESS and compressed to save precious bytes for mobile users.
